This repo contains the old version of my personal website – [mkpanq.com](https://mkpanq.com).

I originally built it from scratch, but over time I wasn’t happy with the design and overall result. That’s why I decided to switch to a more professional-looking template that better reflects my work.

Keeping this here for reference and as a part of the journey.
