      Hi, I'm Marek 👋🏻 — a fullstack developer with a <span
        class="font-semibold">frontend focus</span
      >
      and a
      <span class="font-semibold">product mindset</span>. I've worked on
      everything from greenfield apps to multi-year legacy systems, often
      bridging the gap between design, tech, and business needs. I care about
      building things that make sense for the user and the team behind it — and
      I enjoy working in collaborative, feedback-driven environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strongest experience is with <span class="font-semibold"
        >React, TypeScript, and Ruby on Rails</span
      >, but I try to stay tech-agnostic and choose tools that fit the problem,
      not the other way around. I've worked in agile teams, led frontend
      development on larger features, and contributed across the stack when
      needed. I'm also <span class="font-semibold">PSPO I certified</span>, and
      I often work closely with designers and product folks to turn ideas into
      something real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've worked across different industries and team setups —
      from fast-moving startups to more structured environments — often in
      remote, international teams. I value <span class="font-semibold"
        >clear communication, flexibility, and taking ownership</span
      > — not just of the features I build, but of the product as a whole. I approach
      development with a mix of curiosity, pragmatism, and care for both the technical
      and human side of the work.
    </p>
